Elastic File System(EFS):
------------------------
Elastic File System â€” is a Network File System that can be created and mounted to EC2 instances. (File sharing btw two ec2 instances)
One of the advantages of EFS is that you don't need to provision the size, as you would need to do with a disk drive (ESB), and you can mount it in several EC2 Linus instances at the same time, making it an easy way to share files between these EC2 instances.


Mounting EFS in 2 approaches: 
1. Using Ec2 Launch wizard
2. Using EFS mount helper (amazon)

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59701689/ec2-instance-connect-there-was-a-problem-setting-up-the-instance-connection
In order to connect to your instance with "EC2 Instance Connect (browser-based SSH connection)" you need to install ec2-instance-connect to your AMI.
Try connecting to your instance via "A standalone SSH client" (eg. putty) and installing it with a command:
sudo yum install ec2-instance-connect
or (for Ubuntu):
sudo apt-get install ec2-instance-connect 
To me this worked, and I could then easily access my instance via browser next time.
The more detailed explanation is found here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-connect-set-up.html
