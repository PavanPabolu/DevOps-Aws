What is a ECS in AWS?
Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) is a highly scalable, high performance container management service that supports Docker containers and allows you to easily run applications on a managed cluster of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances.

What is difference between ECS and EC2?
The largest difference for EC2 is that it deploys isolated VM instances with auto scaling support, and ECS deploys scalable clusters of managed Docker containers. Enterprises can use ECS to scale web applications, perform batch processing, and run services in a hybrid environment to deliver better services to users.

Is AWS ECS using Kubernetes?
Amazon ECS is similar to EKS, but it relies on a proprietary control plane instead of Kubernetes.

What is difference between AWS ECS and Kubernetes?
Image result

Is ECS same as Docker?
Amazon ECS uses Docker images in task definitions to launch containers. Docker is a technology that provides the tools for you to build, run, test, and deploy distributed applications in containers.

Is AWS ECS serverless?
With ECS Anywhere, AWS engineers manage the backend, so you don't have to worry about operating cluster management software. That's a major advantage if you have wanted to manage containers on your own infrastructure. However, you can still go serverless by directing the tasks and services to AWS Fargate.

Which is better ECS or Kubernetes?
Multi-cloud
Well, this is obvious, and the winner is Kubernetes. A compelling reason is that it can be deployed on-prem or any cloud provider, including Azure, Google Cloud, or Amazon. In the case of ECS, the platform is closed code; as a consequence, it has a vendor lock-in and is not cloud-agnostic.

Why Kubernetes is better than ECS?
Built-in security: Kubernetes creates its own private network with its own isolated, secure networking. Vendor agnostic: Unlike Amazon ECS, Kubernetes is a vendor agnostic platform that can run on any cloud provider or on-premises. Kubernetes workloads are portable and support hybrid and multicloud strategies

Can ECS run without EC2?
EC2 is a compute service that enables applications to run on AWS, whereas ECS is an AWS service used primarily to orchestrate Docker containers. They can work together, but they don't have to. EC2 runs in a great many instances and environments with ECS being in the picture.

Is EC2 part of ECS?
An Amazon ECS container instance is an Amazon EC2 instance that is running the Amazon ECS container agent and has been registered into an Amazon ECS cluster. When you run tasks with Amazon ECS using the EC2 launch type or an Auto Scaling group capacity provider, your tasks are placed on your active container instances.

What is the purpose of ECS?
ECS is used by institutions for making bulk payment of amounts towards distribution of dividend, interest, salary, pension, etc., or for bulk collection of amounts towards telephone / electricity / water dues, cess / tax collections, loan instalment repayments, periodic investments in mutual funds, etc.

What is the difference between AWS ECR and ECS?
The primary difference between Amazon ECR and ECS is that while ECR provides the repository that stores all code that has been written and packaged as a Docker image, the ECS takes these files and actively uses them in the deployment of applications.
