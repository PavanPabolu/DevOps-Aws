Checkout
git checkout --orphan latest_branch

Add all the files
git add -A

Commit the changes
git commit -am "commit message"

Delete the branch
git branch -D main

Rename the current branch to main
git branch -m main

Finally, force update your repository
git push -f origin main

PS: this will not keep your old commit history around

If you are sure you want to remove all commit history, simply delete the .git directory in your project root (note that it's hidden). Then initialize a new repository in the same folder and link it to the GitHub repository:

git init
git remote add origin git@github.com:user/repo
now commit your current version of code

git add *
git commit -am 'message'
and finally force the update to GitHub:

git push -f origin master
However, I suggest backing up the history (the .git folder in the repository) before taking these steps!
